# XGBoost Learning-to-Rank API

A production-ready implementation of a **Learning-to-Rank (LTR)** model using **XGBoost**, served through a **FastAPI** microservice.  
This project simulates a real-world use case of ranking **Moving Service Providers (MSPs)** — logistics vendors who bid for moving jobs — and demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and deploy a ranking model using modern MLOps practices.

## 🧠 What This Project Is About

In logistics platforms (like movers, delivery, or service aggregators), customers post jobs and multiple vendors or **Moving Service Providers (MSPs)** respond with quotes.  
The system must **rank** these MSPs by their likelihood of providing the best outcome — considering factors like distance, reliability, price, and ratings.

This project uses **Learning-to-Rank (LTR)** machine learning to automate that process.

Instead of manually sorting vendors by heuristics (e.g., lowest price or closest distance), an ML model learns an **optimal ranking function** based on historical outcomes such as job acceptance, completion, and customer satisfaction.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Data Simulation**  
   A synthetic dataset of 50 job requests × 10 MSP candidates per job is created.  
   Each candidate has features like:
   - `distance_km` – distance to customer  
   - `price_quote` – quoted price for the move  
   - `past_accept_rate` – MSP’s previous acceptance rate  
   - `completion_rate` – fraction of completed jobs  
   - `rating` – average customer rating  

2. **Label Generation**  
   Historical outcomes are converted into **relevance labels** (0–3) indicating how good the match was.

3. **Model Training**  
   An `XGBRanker` is trained in **pairwise** mode to predict the optimal order of MSPs for each job.

4. **Evaluation**  
   The model is evaluated using **NDCG@5**, a standard ranking metric in search and recommendation systems.

5. **Serving**  
   The trained model is wrapped in a **FastAPI** endpoint:
   ```bash
   POST /rank-msps
---
It accepts a job and a list of MSP candidates, scores each one, and returns them sorted by predicted relevance.
